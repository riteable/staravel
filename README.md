# Larawire

A basic Laravuxt + Livewire project template.

## Usage

To start the project for development, just run:

```
$ make up
```

This is a shortcut for a `docker-compose up --build` command, which starts all the necessary containers for the application to run.

To stop all the containers run the following:

```
$ make down
```
